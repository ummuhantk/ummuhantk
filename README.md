👋 Hello! I'm a passionate Software Test Engineer who blends quality assurance with innovation in the tech world.

🧭 With a background in customer-centric roles, I bring a unique perspective to software testing — one that focuses on both user experience and product excellence. After successfully completing a comprehensive SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) Bootcamp, I’ve built a solid foundation in testing.

🛠️ Technical Skills:
- Automation testing with **Java + Selenium WebDriver + Cucumber**
- Manual testing (UI, API, mobile, and database)
- Tools: **Git**, **GitHub**, **Jira**, **Postman**, **MySQL**, **Appium**
- Methodologies: **Agile** & **Scrum**

🚀 I turn theoretical knowledge into practice through real-world projects, combining strong technical expertise with sharp analytical thinking.

🎯 My goal: Obtain the **ISTQB certification**, deepen my QA expertise, and explore the intersection of software testing and data science.

📊 Interests:  
**Python**, **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, **AI Tools**, **Test Automation**, **Quality Engineering**

🔍 A curious, solution-oriented, and lifelong learner — I use this space to share projects, track progress, and connect with the global dev community.
