👋 Hello!
I have embarked on a new journey to shape my career in the field of technology and software testing.

🚀 I am currently participating in an SDET (Software Development Engineer in Test) bootcamp program. During the training, I am working on:

✅ Automation testing with Java and Selenium 🖥️
✅ Manual testing processes 📝

🎯 My goal is to specialize in software testing and obtain the ISTQB certification 🏆 soon to support my professional development 📈.

💡 My areas of interest include machine learning 🤖, Python 🐍, data science 📊, AI tools 🧠, Java ☕, and technology-based solution development 🔧.
